# Expense Tracker

This is a very simple expense tracker that has a graphical chart representation of a user's expenses per month with the help of theming & Material Design. This application has the capability to gather user's input so that the user can add their own expenses. This flutter app is also responsive & adaptive, it is able to handle different device sizes & adapting the UI to different operating systems (Material & Cupertino) by using only one codebase/one widget tree, and then only render certain sub-trees based on the platform/device size
